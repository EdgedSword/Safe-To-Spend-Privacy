<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

<p><strong>SafeToSpend</strong> is designed with privacy in mind. Your financial data belongs to you.</p>

<h2>Data Collection</h2>
<p>
SafeToSpend does not collect, track, or sell personal data.
All budgeting and expense data you enter is stored locally on your device.
</p>

<h2>iCloud Sync</h2>
<p>
If iCloud is enabled on your device, SafeToSpend uses Apple’s iCloud (CloudKit)
to securely sync your data across your own devices.
This data is associated with your Apple ID and is not accessible to the developer.
</p>

<h2>In-App Purchases</h2>
<p>
SafeToSpend offers a one-time in-app purchase to unlock Pro features.
Purchases are processed securely by Apple via the App Store.
The developer does not receive or store payment information.
</p>

<h2>Notifications</h2>
<p>
If you enable notifications, they are scheduled locally on your device
using Apple’s notification services.
No notification data is sent to external servers.
</p>

<h2>Widgets</h2>
<p>
Home Screen and Lock Screen widgets access the same local or iCloud-synced data
used by the app. No additional data collection occurs.
</p>

<h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
<p>
SafeToSpend does not use third-party analytics, advertising SDKs,
tracking frameworks, or data brokers.
</p>

<h2>Data Sharing</h2>
<p>
Your data is never shared with third parties.
Exported data (such as CSV files) is generated only at your request
and remains under your control.
</p>

<h2>Contact</h2>
